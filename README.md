# Nitro Type companion
No friends to race with? Race with a bot that matches either your's or someone else's wpm. Please credit me if you use in another project.

## Directions
* Clone repository.
* In terminal, do the commands:
   ```
    pip install selenium
    pip install webdriver_manager
    ```
* Scroll to bottom where main() is called and put your public profile link in as the argument.
* Run the program.
* The bot will friend request you if you are not friends yet.
* Invite the bot to your game.
  * If it does not accept within 30 seconds or so, send it again.
* Play as normal.
* The bot will type at around your average wpm.

## To Use Someone Else's Average WPM
* Make sure you are already friends with the bot.
* Instead of putting your profile link into main, put the other person's in. 
* Proceed normally.

## Troubleshooting
* Make sure you have installed the dependencies, followed directions correctly.
* Try restarting the program a couple times.
* If all else fails, open issue and I will be glad to help.
